Project1: JEWELLIST 
===============

ABOUT
------------
Jewellist is the online platform where you can browse through Australian jewellery designers products. The idea of this project start from a visit to Paddington on a fine Sunday afternoon. There are many designer boutiques along the oxford street and I wondered why I've never known these designer brands before (even though I love jewellery), Australian designers are amazing. 

Therefore, this project is all about "Australian jewellery designer brands and where to find them."
